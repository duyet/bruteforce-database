# How to contribute
1. Fork the project on Github. 
2. Create a topic branch for your changes (ex: `add-yahoo-password-list`).
3. If the project contains a `package.json` or a `bower.json` file add yourself in the contributors array (or `authors` in the case of `bower.json`; if the array does not exist, create it):
    ```
    {
      "contributors": [
         "Your Name <and@email.address> (http://your.website)"
      ]
    }
    ```

4. Create a pull request on Github (these are also a great place to start a conversation around a patch as early as possible)
